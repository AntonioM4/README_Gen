# ReadMe generator
## Description
We wanted to create a project that will help us create readme files for out projects
We were tired of creating a read me from scratch on every project
To easily create README files without ever leaving our console
We no longer need to create a README from scratch 
I learned how to create files with FS and how to take a user's input and use those inputs to create the responses in the file
